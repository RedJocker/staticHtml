        <h4>Project configuration</h4>
        <p>
            Projects should begin by cloning the
            <a href="https://github.com/hyperskill/android-projects-template">
                <em>Android-Projects-Template</em>
            </a>.
            This template will help you start writing an Android project
            on the HyperSkill platform with the right format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow the instructions in <code>README.md</code> inside the root folder of
            <em>Android-Projects-Template</em> repository to change the general template
            into your project&rsquo;s initial template.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avoid changing <code>settings.gradle</code> and root level <code>build.gradle</code>.
            For stage level <code>build.gradle</code>
            try to add only the extra dependencies you need without changing other parameters.
            Build config is very sensitive and can be system-dependent,
            so to prevent users from having build failures
            we should have only the tested build configuration.
            Some libraries may require other changes to the build configuration
            but those should be discussed with track experts and tested properly
            before being deployed in production.

        <h4>Robolectric tests</h4>
        <p>
            We don't do <em>"instrumentation tests"</em>,
            that is, tests that run on physical/emulated devices.
            Those tests don't work well with eduToolsPlugin,
            and build configuration for that kind of tests is also problematic.
            Besides that, they are much slower and more demanding in terms of resources
            (ram and hard disk since we would need to require
             at least one common emulated device to be installed for all users).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of that, we only do Robolectric tests.
            Robolectric runs on a JVM, which means we don't need any devices to run tests, and it runs much faster.
        </p>

        <h4>Espresso libraries on Robolectric</h4>
        <p>
            It is possible to use espresso libraries on Robolectric tests.
            For that, you need to include the following dependencies
            on root level <code>build.gradle</code>
            in the section that has other <code>testImplementation</code> statements:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
testImplementation 'androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.5'
testImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.5.1'</code></pre>
        <p>
            But, for most common cases, you don't really need them.
            If you really feel like including espresso libraries,
            consult with track experts.
        </p>

        <h4>Black box testing</h4>
        <p>
            One very important aspect of Hyperskill tests is that we should stick to
            <strong>black box testing</strong>,
            which means we should not be directly calling
            functions/classes/identifiers that will be created by the users.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the beginning of any stage, users should be able to invoke tests
            and receive an appropriate AssertionError without doing any coding.
            Breaking black box testing by calling functions/classes/identifiers from the implementation side
            will lead to build failures, which we don't want to happen, ideally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The template provides a function called <code>findViewByString</code> to retrieve views.
            It should be used by tests instead of <code>findViewById</code> to avoid making direct references to view identifiers.
            For other identifiers,
            you can use <code>activity.resource.getIdentifier()</code>
            that will return an ID number based on the provided <code>idString</code>.
            The <code>findViewByString</code> method uses
            <code>activity.resource.getIdentifier()</code>:
            you can look at its implementation if you have doubts on how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The template will provide a reference to the <code>activity</code> typed as <code>Activity</code>.
            Don’t cast it to a specific kind of activity like <code>MainActivity</code>
            — doing so would lead to breaking the black box
            since you would be reaching the implementation of specific functions/properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Activities, we end up having to make direct references
            to the specific activity class while setting up the activity test.
            On <strong>single activity projects</strong> this won't result in build failure
            because we provide the <strong>skeleton</strong> of the <code>MainActivity</code>
            on the initial template for users.
        </p>
        <p>
            For <strong>projects with multiple activities</strong>, avoiding build failures will probably not be possible,
            because we will need to make a reference to an activity class that does not exist
            in user implementation while setting up tests for that activity.
            You should warn users in your description that such build failure is expected until they create that class.
        </p>
        <p>
            The usual flow of tests interacts with <strong>widgets</strong> (buttons, editText, etc)
            and then makes assertions on the outcomes
            (the widget has certain text,
             a toast was produced and has text,
             an alertDialog was shown,
             an intent has been launched,
             etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of black box testing, <strong>mocks</strong> will not be used as much as you would expect,
            because <strong>mocks</strong> generally end up assuming a lot on the implementation side.
        </p>

        <h4>Shadows</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Shadow</strong> is a very important concept for <em>Robolectric</em>.
            They are the secret ingredient that makes running Android code possible on the <em>JVM</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shadows are runtime replacements
            of actual classes that keep a reference to the instance that is being replaced.
            Most Android code that will be running during tests is, in fact, Shadows.
            That is so because Android code expects to run on
            a physical/emulated device, but Robolectric tests will be running on the JVM.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the most part, you won't notice any difference,
            but there are some things Shadows will just not do
            because running code on JVM is not the same as running code on devices.
            (However, they can act as spies or mocks and be helpful even in these situations.)
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of that is <code>ShadowToast</code>,
            where toasts are not really shown since there is no device to show them.
            But the <code>ShadowToast</code> class will act as a spy and store toasts that were supposed to be shown,
            giving you access to those, so that it is still possible to make assertions on Toasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to create <strong>custom shadows</strong>,
            which can be handy if you need to mock or spy something,
            but you won’t be able to make shadows for neither
            <code>java.lang</code> nor <code>java.util</code>.
            This limitation has to do with the order of class loading.
            Robolectric class loader is instantiated after some java classes have already been loaded,
            so it is unable to replace them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Robolectric libraries</strong> provide shadows for the most common cases.
            It is also possible to extend existing shadows.
            You can read more about shadows and creating custom shadows in
            <a href="https://robolectric.org/extending/">Robolectric documentation</a>.

            The template provides more information in the documents folder. 
            There you will also find a link to an example repository that contains some examples of tests.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            In this section, you learned how to create tests for Android projects.
            We looked at the project setup and discussed how to do testing in different ways.
            We covered the main methods of the Test Android library and showed how you can apply them in practice.
